# ABM Web - Create Your Todo List & Diary

Smith College CSC151: Programming Language Concepts

This is a Ruby on Rails web site where users can create their own todo list and write a diary. Users can easily organize their day by using the todo list and make a time to reflect their day by writing the diary whenever they want. 

From the college students' perspectives, we implemented not only the todo list but also the diary to our web app. We hope to support busy college students' academic part of the life as well as their mental health.
